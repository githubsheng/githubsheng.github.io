    <p>For reviewers: </p>
    <p>Q: Why aren't we seeing super small circles?</p>
    <p>
      A: The original requirement states circles should have random diameters ranging from 10px to 100px. However,
      during testing I realize 10px circle is too small and ... not fun anymore. Therefore, I keep the diameter range to be
      30px to 100px. Occasionally the game also spawns some really small circles (20px) and hitting them gives player
      extra bonus. Having said this, the game still works with range of 10px to 100px. You may change the range
      inside Circle class constructor.
    </p>
    <p>Q: Game seems easier than I expected?</p>
    <p>
      A: You touch the circle, and if the touch point is within the circle, you hit the circle and get the points,
      otherwise you miss it. For very small points, it is too easy to miss it. So I made the game to be more tolerant.
      As long as your touch point is close enough, even though it may not be within the circle, it is still counted as
      a hit.
    </p>
    <p>I also multiply the points you get by 10. The original requirement <i>"The score should be incremented by a value
      inversely proportional to the size of the dot, with 10px dots worth 10 points, and 100px dots worth 1 point. "</i> do
    not make sense in practice because when we convert the point to integer, both 100px circle and 51px circle will all result in 1 point</p>
    <p>Q: I see a bunch of images rather than circles. How do these images map to circles?</p>
    <p>A: You can click on the score board on the top, that will toggle debug mode and you can see how images are
    mapped to circles.</p>
